# NVIMIT

My personal NeoVim configuration, designed around the space leader key.
Inspired heavily by [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) and [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim).

## Installation

Just clone the repository wherever you want, change directory into it, and then run the installation script provided.
Please notice that the installation script sets up symbolic links from the clone the folder to the `.config/nvim` folder. Therefore, the cloned repository cannot be deleted.
